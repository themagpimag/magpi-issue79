0) Install EdgeTPU environment using the supplied instructions (download a python-tflite-source directory and run install. Make sure the demos in that package work, as advertised)

1) Unpack and install additional dependencies for teachable machine:

tar xvzf teachable_rpi3.tgz

cd ./teachable

sh ./install_requirements.sh

2) Test the button UI (ensure cabling is correct)

sudo python3 teachable.py --testui

If the wiring is correct you should see the 4 LEDs wiggle/flash and then it will run an infinite loop displaying which buttons are pressed. If you press a button the respective LED should light up.

3) Run the teachable machine

sh run.sh

At first the code will have no examples so no LED shoul dlight up. When you press a single button the code takes a snapshot of the image and it’s embedding (run through the accelerator) and saves it labeling it with that button. THus you have 4 classes you can “teach” tough i usually reserve “red” for background (just press it with nothing held up). THe other three can be used to learn finger shapes, faces, objects etc.

The white button will wipe the memory and reset the state to the beginning.
